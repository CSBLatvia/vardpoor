One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.

  Optional for single-stage sampling design as it will be estimated from sample data. Recommended for multi-stage sampling design as \code{N_h} can not be correctly estimated from the sample data in this case. If \code{N_h} is not used in case of multi-stage sampling design (for example, because this information is not available), it is advisable to set \code{fh_zero = TRUE}.

  If \code{period} \bold{is} \code{NULL}. A two-column data object convertible to \code{data.table} with rows for each stratum. The first column should contain stratum code. The second column - the number of primary sampling units in the population of each stratum.

  If \code{period} \bold{is not} \code{NULL}. A three-column data object convertible to \code{data.table} with rows for each intersection of strata and period. The first column should contain period. The second column should contain stratum code. The third column - the number of primary sampling units in the population of each stratum and period.
